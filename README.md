A development blog for Pyvale found here [https://computer-aided-validation-laboratory.github.io/devupdates/](https://computer-aided-validation-laboratory.github.io/devupdates/)

To create a post posts:

1. Clone the repo

2. Make your markdown post in the posts folder. For this:
	1. The name of the markdown must be in the form YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md
	2. The .md file must start with the yaml header as seen below and in the example posts, where TITLE is the name of the post, and YYYY-MM-DD is the date.

```
---
layout: posts
title: TITLE
date: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```
3. Push changes, and they will be applied to the webpage
